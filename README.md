## Description

Introduction to systems programming in C on UNIX. Students will be introduced to tools for compilation, dynamic linking, debugging, editing, automatic rebuilding, and version control. Some aspects of the UNIX system call interface will be studied, drawn from this list: process creation, signals, terminal I/O, file I/O, inter-process communication, threads, network protocol stacks, programming with sockets, and introduction to RPC. Style issues to be covered include: naming, layout, commenting, portability, design for robustness and debugability, and language pitfalls.
